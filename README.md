# hangman
A simple python hangman game. Part of a self-challenge week while learning how to write python inspired by https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/

Program grabs from a list of words, posts an illustration of how far you are in the game.
Basically all just stock python stuff, no external libraries or modules aside from random
